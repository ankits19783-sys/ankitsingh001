            <p>My name is Ankit Singh, and I’m passionate about software engineering and web development. I enjoy learning how software works and how different technologies come together to build useful applications. I’m especially interested in front-end and full-stack development, where I can design user-friendly websites and also manage backend logic.

I’m currently building my skills in programming languages like C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m exploring frameworks such as Node.js and React. My goal is to become a skilled software engineer who can create efficient, scalable, and innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.

I love continuous learning, teamwork, and improving my problem-solving skills through projects and challenges.</p>
